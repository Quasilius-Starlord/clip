/**
 * The layer is the central rendering context on which 2D vector graphics
 * operations, such as rendering text and drawing polygons, take place.
 *
 * Layers are container objects and have to be bound to a specific rendering
 * backend before they can be used. Users should create layers using one of the
 * layer_bind_* methods, for example `layer_bind_png` or `layer_bind_svg`.
 *
 * Since the layer is a low-level interface, it is recommended that you use one
 * of the many drawing helper functions, such as `strokePath` or `drawText`, instead
 * of interacting directly with the Layer. Nevertheless, all supported drawing
 * operations are available through the `apply` method of the layer. Please refer
 * to `layer_op.h` for more information on the low-level operations API.
 *
 * Once you are finished with all drawing operations, it is important to call
 * `layer_submit` to make the results visible.
