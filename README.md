`plotfx` is a command line tool for creating charts from CSV files. It supports a
number of different plot types and other diagrams. Charts can be customized
using a configuration language similar to CSS.

[Documentation](https://plotfx.org/)


Getting Started
---------------

Here is how to generate a simple line chart using plotfx:

    $ plotfx -in example_chart.plot -out example_chart.svg

Output File (`example_chart.svg`):

[![A simple line chart](./examples/linecharts/lines_with_points.svg)](./examples/linecharts/lines_with_points.plot)

Input File (`example_chart.plot`):

    plot {
      axis-top: off;
      axis-right: off;

      ymin: -10;
      ymax: 32;

      series {
        title: "New York";
        point-size: 3.3pt;
        xs: csv(testdata/city_temperatures.csv, month);
        ys: csv(testdata/city_temperatures.csv, new_york);
      }

      series {
        title: "北京市";
        point-size: 3.3pt;
        xs: csv(testdata/city_temperatures.csv, month);
        ys: csv(testdata/city_temperatures.csv, beijing);
      }

      # ...
    }
