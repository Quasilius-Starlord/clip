PlotFX
======

PlotFX is a command line tool and library for plotting data. The appearance of
plots can be customized using a lightweight syntax that is very similar to CSS.

You can run PlotFX from the command line, where it generates SVG, PNG and PDF
output files. Additionally, you can embed it into your own application using the
C API.

Project Status
--------------

**WARNING**: The master branch recently underwent a significant refactoring and the
stability is currently beta/experimental. Maybe not even that. It will take a few
more weeks to stabilize and document everything.


Getting Started
---------------

Here is how to draw a simple timeseries chart using plotfx:

    $ plotfx --in example_chart.ptx --out example_chart.svg

Output File (`example_chart.svg`):

[![A simple line chart](/examples/linecharts/simple_timeseries.svg)](./examples/linecharts/simple_timeseries.ptx)

Input File (`example_chart.ptx`):

    width: 1200px;
    height: 280px;

    scale-y-min: 0;
    scale-y-max: 140;

    lines {
      xs: csv('measurement.csv', time);
      ys: csv('measurement.csv', value2);
      colors: #06c;
    }

    axis {
      position: bottom;
      format: datetime("%H:%M:%S");
    }

    axis {
      position: left;
      layout: linear(20);
    }


For more examples, please see [the examples page](https://plotfx.org/examples).


Building
--------

To build PlotFX, you need an up-to-date C++ compiler, cmake, libharfbuzz and
libfreetype. Run:

    $ cmake .
    $ make

To install the `plotfx` binary into your system, run `make install`:

    $ make install

To run the test suite, run `make test`:

    $ make test


Acknowledgements
----------------

PlotFX is the successor of the FnordMetric ChartSQL project by the same authors.

Parts of the new chart specification syntax and semantics were inspired by ideas
from the "Grammar of Graphics" [0] and the ggplot2 project.
