`plotfx` is a command line tool for creating charts and other data-driven
visualizations. It is partially based on ideas from the "Grammar of Graphics" and
the ggplot2 R library. One of the main goals for PlotFX is that using it should be
simple and fun.

PlotFX is a standalone tool - it is not required to know any specific programming
language to use it. Charts are specified using a lightweight syntax that is very
similar to CSS and input data is usually read from CSV files.

You can run PlotFX from the command line, where it generates SVG, PNG and PDF
output files. Additionally, you can embed it into your own application using the
C API.

**WARNING**: The project is currently a work-in-progress. I'm currently working
on removing the old SQL chart specification language and replacing it with the
new CSS-like syntax. This might take a while...

Getting Started
---------------

Here is how to generate a simple line chart using plotfx:

    $ plotfx -in example_chart.plot -out example_chart.svg

Output File (`example_chart.svg`):

[![A simple line chart](./examples/linecharts/lines_with_points.svg)](./examples/linecharts/lines_with_points.plot)

Input File (`example_chart.plot`):

    plot {
      axis-top: off;
      axis-right: off;

      ymin: -10;
      ymax: 32;

      series {
        title: "New York";
        point-size: 3.3pt;
        xs: csv(testdata/city_temperatures.csv, month);
        ys: csv(testdata/city_temperatures.csv, new_york);
      }

      series {
        title: "北京市";
        point-size: 3.3pt;
        xs: csv(testdata/city_temperatures.csv, month);
        ys: csv(testdata/city_temperatures.csv, beijing);
      }

      # ...
    }

Building
--------

To build PlotFX, you need an up-to-date C++ compiler, cmake, libharfbuzz and
libfreetype. Run:

    $ cmake .
    $ make

To install the `plotfx` binary into your system, run `make install`:

    $ make install

To run the test suite, run `make test`:

    $ make test

Parts of the new chart specification syntax and semantics were inspired by ideas
from the "Grammar of Graphics" and the ggplot2 project.
