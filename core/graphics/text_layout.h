/**
 * A text span represents a discrete, non-breakable piece of text. Text spans are
 * the smallest unit of text for layout.
 *
 * If any kind of line wrapping is desired, the input text must be split into
 * text spans so that line breaking can be performed on a per-span basis.
 *
 * One important caveat of this is that text shaping will also be performed on a
 * per-span basis, so the spans should be as large as possible for the best text
 * shaping results. Note that font fallback selection is also performed per-span,
 * so ideally any span should be renderable with a single font from the font
 * stack.
 *
 * In latin scripts, text spans should probably correspond to word boundaries.
 * In other scripts, text spans should correspond to whatever unit of text is
 * small enough to allow for text breaking on span-level but large enough so that
 * per-span shaping of text is sufficient.
 *
 * It is allowed to break the line after or before each text span, i.e. spans
 * must be given so that it is legal to place each text span at the beginning of
 * a new line. However it is *not* allowed to break a span itself into smaller
 * pieces; all text in the span must be put onto the same line.
 *
 * This interface should enable us to have a high degree of decoupling between
 * the text shaping and layout parts. However, one tradeoff is that it does not
 * allow users to implement line breaking at  character boundaries (i.e breaking
 * and hyphenization of words).
 *
 * The text data of this span as a UTF-8 encoded string in logical character
