# PlotFX v0.2.0

PlotFX is a tool for creating data-driven graphics; it allows you to create
parametric illustrations such as charts and dashboards using a lightweight
CSS-like syntax.

You can run PlotFX from the command line, where it generates SVG, PNG and PDF
output files. Additionally, you can embed it into your own application using the
C API.

PlotFX is built in the hope that using it will be quick, simple and fun.

**WARNING**: The master branch recently underwent a significant refactoring and the
stability is currently beta/experimental. Maybe not even that. It will take a few
more weeks to stabilize and document everything.
