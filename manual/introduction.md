# fviz v0.4.0

fviz is a command line program for creating charts and other data-driven
illustrations.

It reads input data from text and CSV files and produces the output graphic as
a SVG or PNG file. All charts are highly customizable using a simple s-expression
based syntax.

In addition to the command line program, fviz is available as the libfviz
software library which can be embedded into any application that can link to C
libraries.

**BETA:** Please note that fviz is pre-1.0 software under active development;
It is usable, but things might generally still be a bit rough around the edges.
To see what already works, have a look at the [Examples](https://fviz.org/examples) page.
