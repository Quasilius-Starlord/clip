This page will guide you through creating a simple first plot and then give you
pointers to more detailed documentation.


### The first image

A minimal example file for PlotFX is this one:

    width: 1200px;
    height: 600px;

    points {
      xs: 10px 40px;
      ys: 20px 400px;
      colors: #06c #c06;
    }

Save this to `example.ptx` and run it using the command line below:

    plotfx --in example.ptx --out example.svg

If you do that, PlotFX will produce a white 1200x600 pixel image with two coloured
dots:

It's not the most useful example in the world, but it shows how to run files
through PlotFX and illustrates that PlotFX is in a way more similar to a drawing
tool like Inkscape than to a chart generator.

### Parametric drawing


### Adding a scale, title and legend

[![A simple line chart](./examples/linecharts/simple_timeseries.svg)](./examples/linecharts/simple_timeseries)

The simple line chart from above was generated with PlotFX using the following
command line:

    $ plotfx --in example_chart.ptx --out example_chart.svg

Here is the input file from which the above plot was generated (`example_chart.ptx`):

    width: 1200px;
    height: 280px;

    scale-y-min: 0;
    scale-y-max: 140;

    lines {
      xs: csv('measurement.csv', time);
      ys: csv('measurement.csv', value2);
      colors: #06c;
    }

    axis {
      position: bottom;
      format: datetime("%H:%M:%S");
    }

    axis {
      position: left;
      layout: linear(20);
    }
