This page will guide you through creating a simple first plot and then give you
pointers to more detailed documentation.


### The first image

A minimal example file for PlotFX is this one:

    width: 1200px;
    height: 600px;

    points {
      xs: 10px 40px;
      ys: 20px 400px;
      colors: #06c #c06;
    }

Save this to `example.ptx` and run it using the command line below:

    plotfx --in example.ptx --out example.svg

If you do that, PlotFX will produce a white 1200x600 pixel image with two coloured
dots:

It's not the most useful example in the world, but it shows how to run files
through PlotFX and illustrates that PlotFX is in a way more similar to a drawing
tool like Inkscape than to a chart generator.
